# Viewing Canada's Data

A barebones visualization of Vancouver's Government employees remuneration. The data contains all employee's salaries who exceed $75,000/year. I was curious if one department received higher wages than others.

Overall, the average salary was roughly equal across departments; the engineering and VFRS/OEM departments had the highest distribution of total income.
